$$(r,\theta)$$

-   r is directed distance

-   θ is angle

## Conversion


$$x^{2} + y^{2} = r^{2}$$, $$x = r\cos\theta$$, $$y = r\sin\theta$$

$$\cos\theta = \frac{x}{r}$$, $$\sin\theta = \frac{y}{r}$$,
$$\tan\theta = \frac{y}{x}$$

### Coordinates

#### R → P

$$(\sqrt{x^2+y^2},arctan(\frac{y}{x}))$$

#### P → R

$$(rcos\theta,rsin\theta)$$

## Equation Types

Generally, equations with $$\sin$$ are symmetric to the y-axis (except for
lemniscates), while equations with $$\cos$$ are symmetric to the x-axis.

### Lines


$$r = a\sec\theta$$ is the same as $$x = a$$(vertical line)

$$r = a\csc\theta$$ is the same as $$y = a$$(horizontal line)

### Circles
#### Standard Circle
 $$r = a$$

 -   The same
     as $$x^{2} + y^{2} = a^2$$

 -   Center at the origin

 -   Radius of a
#### Sine Circle
 $$r = a\sin\theta$$ or $$r = - a\sin\theta$$

 -   Radius of $$\frac{a}{2}$$

 -   a dictates how far up or
     down the top/bottom of the
     circle is
### Cosine Circle
 $$r = a\cos\theta$$ or
 $$r = -a\cos\theta$$

 -   Radius of $$\frac{a}{2}$$

 -   a dictates how far left or
     right the edge of the circle
     is


### Limacons
$$r = a \pm b\sinθ$$ or $$r = a \pm b\cosθ$$

If...

  a = b                            → Cardioid ♥

  a < b                            → Inner loop

  a \> b and $$\frac{a}{b} < 2$$     → Dimpled circle

  a \> b and $$\frac{a}{b} \geq 2$$  → Flat circle

### Roses


  $$r = a\ sin\ b\theta$$ or $$r = a\ cos\ b\theta$$

-   If *b* is odd there are *b* petals, but if *b* is even there are
    *2b* petals.

-   Each petal is *a* units long.



### Lemniscates


Each petal is of a length.

 $$r^{2} = a^{2}sin2\theta$$        
                                  
 - Symmetrical to $$\theta = \frac{\pi}{4}$$ (the same as $$y = x$$)

 $$r^{2} = a^{2}cos2\theta$$        
- Symmetrical to x-axis
