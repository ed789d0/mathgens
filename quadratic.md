Everything on this page applies given a quadratic equation in the form $$Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0$$, where A, B, and C are constants.

Use

$$x=\frac{-B\pm\sqrt{B^{2}-4AC}}{2A}$$

to find all solutions to the quadratic equation.

## Formulas for the Solutions

$$-\frac{B}{A}$$ is the sum of the solutions.

$$\frac{C}{A}$$ is the product of the solutions.

## Discriminant
The discriminant is $$B^{2}-4AC$$ (the part under the square root in the quadratic formula), and its value means one of three things:
- Greater than zero: there are 2 real solutions.
- Exactly zero: there is 1 real solution.
- Less than zero: there are no real solutions.
