Given a quadratic equation in the form $$Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0$$, where A, B, and C are constants, use

$$x=\frac{-B\pm\sqrt{B^{2}-4AC}}{2A}$$

to find the solutions to the quadratic equation.

Other formulas you can use include:

$$-\frac{b}{a}$$ is the sum of the solutions.

$$\frac{c}{a}$$ is the product of the solutions.
