Use these equations to solve kinematic equations:
## Uniformly Accelerated Motion (UAM)

$$g=9.81\frac{m}{s^{2}}$$

$$v=\frac{d}{t}$$

$$a=\frac{v_f-v_i}{t}$$

$$d=v_{i}t+\frac{1}{2}at^{2}$$

$$v_{f}=v_{i}+at$$

$$v_{f}^{2}=v_{i}^{2}+2ad$$

$$d=\frac{1}{2}(v_{i}+v_{f})t$$

## Constant Velocity Motion

$$d=\bar{v}t$$

(Note: d is also sometimes written as $$\Delta x$$ and sometimes $$d_{f}-d_{i}$$)
## Free Fall
When in free fall:

$$a_{y}=-g=-9.81\frac{m}{s^{2}}$$ (therefore motion in y direction uses UAM equations)

$$a_{x}=0\frac{m}{s^{2}}$$ (therefore motion in x direction uses constant velocity equations)
