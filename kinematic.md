Use these equations to solve kinematic equations:

$$d=\bar{v}t$$ (only used with constant velocity)

$$v=\frac{d}{t}$$

$$a=\frac{v_f-v_i}{t}$$

$$d=v_{i}t+\frac{1}{2}at^{2}$$

$$v_{f}=v_{i}+at$$

$$v_{f}^{2}=v_{i}^{2}+2ad$$

$$d=\frac{1}{2}(v_{i}+v_{f})t$$

(Note: d is also sometimes written as $$\Delta x$$)
